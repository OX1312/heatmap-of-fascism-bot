# Roadmap

## Short-term
- clearer reporter feedback (rejection reasons + fix hints)
- better duplicate detection (proximity + image hash)
- better “NEEDS_INFO” loop (ask for precise location)

## Mid-term
- multi-category reports beyond stickers (e.g., graffiti)
- map/UI filters by category and status
- trust tiers for reporters / distributed moderation teams (per city/region)

## Integrations (optional)
- inbound messenger reporting (Telegram/Signal):
  - photo + hashtag + location
  - optional “Chat = City” default to reduce ambiguity

Notes:
- Messenger tooling can be unofficial and higher maintenance; keep scope minimal in beta.
