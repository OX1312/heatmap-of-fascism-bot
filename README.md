# Heatmap of Fascism

Heatmap of Fascism documents fascist sticker propaganda in public space.
Reports are submitted via Mastodon, reviewed, and mapped to show where stickers appear, persist, or are removed over time.

## How to submit a report

A valid report must include:
• one photo of the sticker
• one location:
  – coordinates (lat, lon)
  – OR street + city
  – OR street crossing + city

Optional:
• sticker type (e.g. party, symbol, slogan)
• date (auto if omitted)

## Hashtags

Everyone:
#stickerreport

Members only (confirmed):
#stickerremoved

Removal reports are only counted if confirmed by this account or submitted by a trusted contributor.

## Processing rules

• reports without a photo or location cannot be processed
• locations are normalized to coordinates (10–50 m accuracy)
• repeated reports update the same spot over time
• each spot tracks first_seen, last_seen, status, and report count

## Map output

The public map shows:
• individual reports
• heatmaps of active locations
• status over time (present / removed / unknown)

All reports are reviewed before appearing on the map.
